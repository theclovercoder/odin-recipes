    <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>These cinnamon roll cookies are a new twist to the cinnamony snickerdoodle cookie.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>½ cup shortening</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon fine salt</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ground cinnamon, or as desired</li>
        <li>2 ¾ cups all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling out dough</li>
     </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
        <li>Sift together all-purpose flour, baking soda, and salt in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Beat together butter and shortening using an electric mixer in another bowl until combined; add sugar and continue beating until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Pour in eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Pour in flour mixture and blend until batter is smooth.</li>
        <li>Dust a work surface with flour and roll out cookie dough with a floured rolling pin into a 1/4-inch thick rectangle. Sprinkle cinnamon generously over the dough. Roll up the dough gently into a log starting on one of the long sides. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 2 to 3 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Unwrap the dough log and carefully slice into 1/4-inch pieces without smashing down the cookie. Place on an ungreased baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden around the edges, about 12 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
